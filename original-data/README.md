This directory includes the original, official election result files published by Wisconsin's election administrators, either the Wisconsin Elections Board (through 2006), the Government Accountability Board (through 2014), or the Wisconsin Elections Commission (2016-2022).

Specifically, the directory includes "ward-by-ward" reports for every Gubernatorial, Presidential, US Senate, and Congressional general election from 2020 through 2022. "Ward-by-ward" is a misnomer, since the results are actually tabulated by "reporting units" which allow wards to be combined under certain circumstances in smaller municipalities.

These files were downloaded in December 2023. At the time of downloading, the Wisconsin Elections Commission hosts files from the past 10 years. Older files are hosted by the Wisconsin Historical Society. See [sources.csv](original-data/sources.csv) for direct links to each source file.
